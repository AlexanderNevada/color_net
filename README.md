# colorNet-pytorch
A Neural Network For Automatic Image Colorization

This project is a PyTorch version of the [ColorNet](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/en/) issued on SIGGRAPH 2016. Please check out the original website for the details.

## Overview
* Net model

* DataSet
[MIT Places205](http://places.csail.mit.edu/user/index.php)  
> Hint: For there are grayscale images in the dataset, so I write a script to remove these images

## Result
![...](readme images/good-result.jpg)
![...](readme images/bad-result.jpg)
For this network is trained by landscape image database, it's work well for scenery pictures. So if you use this network to color Â images of other types, maybe you can't get a satisfying output.
